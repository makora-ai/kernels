# Makora Kernels

A collection of GPU kernels organized by hardware backend.

This repository contains kernel implementations targeting:

- NVIDIA H100  
- NVIDIA B200  
- AMD MI300X  
- Tenstorrent  

All kernels in this repository were automatically generated and validated using **MakoraGenerate**, an automated GPU kernel generation system. Try it yourself at https://generate.makora.com

Some directories include benchmarking harnesses and baseline comparisons. Others provide standalone kernel implementations.

Refer to individual kernel directories for:

- Build and compilation instructions  
- Backend requirements  
- Supported configurations  
- Benchmark details (when available)  

Performance is hardware-dependent.
